Learning meteor by doing. This is an app that syncs up with Assembla in order to simplify any group manual testing that should be done for tickets. It started as a little side project. You will see things being done differently throughout the app (just because I wanted to learn different thingd), and there are many areas asking to be refactored/made more efficient. Please feel free to make a pull request to fix things or add a feature!

*Originally the app pushed changes to assembla as well as pulling, but then I figured no one was using the adding/edit features from the app and removed them. You can check out the old implementation on the master-old branch.
